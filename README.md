## Introduction

The `caddy-mlf` module provides a simulated Machine Learning WAF functionality within the Caddy web server. It aims to detect potentially malicious requests by analyzing request attributes like size, header count, query parameters, and path segments. It also incorporates a basic request correlation mechanism by considering the recent request history from the same client IP.

This module is particularly useful for developers and administrators who need a lightweight and highly configurable WAF solution. By using user-defined ranges and weights, `caddy-mlf` enables fine-tuned control over how requests are evaluated, providing an effective way to simulate and study web application security mechanisms. Moreover, its ability to dynamically adapt to custom scenarios allows it to serve as an educational tool for understanding how web application firewalls function in practice.

**Disclaimer:** This module is a *simulation* and does not implement actual machine learning models. It relies on configurable thresholds and weights to determine anomaly scores. It should not be used in production environments where robust security is critical. Instead, it is a powerful tool for testing, research, and learning purposes. Whether you are experimenting with traffic patterns or analyzing common attack vectors, this module offers insights into traffic anomaly analysis.

## Installation

To install the `caddy-mlf` module, you'll need to build Caddy with this module included. The following steps outline the process for setting up and using the module in your environment.

1. **Install xcaddy:** This utility allows you to build custom versions of Caddy with additional modules.
    ```bash
    go install github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/cmd/xcaddy@latest
    ```

2. **Build Caddy with the module:** Use the `xcaddy` tool to build a custom Caddy binary that includes the `caddy-mlf` module.
    ```bash
    xcaddy build --with github.com/yourusername/caddy-mlf
    ```

   This will create an executable named `caddy` in your current directory. Ensure that the executable has the necessary permissions to be executed in your environment.

3. **Verify installation:** Run the custom `caddy` binary and check that the `ml_waf` module is available by listing the installed modules.

## Usage

To use the `caddy-mlf` module, you need to configure it within your Caddyfile. The directive for this module is `ml_waf`. By including this directive in your server configuration, you can activate and customize the behavior of the WAF based on your specific needs.

### Basic Configuration

The basic configuration example below demonstrates how to set up the module with common settings. This configuration can be adapted to suit the requirements of different environments and applications. It provides a starting point for experimenting with thresholds and weights to achieve the desired level of security.

```caddyfile
{
    admin off
    order ml_waf before respond
    log {
        level debug
    }
}

:8080 {
    handle {
        ml_waf {
            # Thresholds
            anomaly_threshold 0.8                  # Anomaly score above which traffic is marked as suspicious
            blocking_threshold 0.95                # Anomaly score above which traffic is blocked

            # Normal ranges for request attributes
            normal_request_size_range 50 2000      # Min and max size (in bytes) of a normal request
            normal_header_count_range 3 30         # Min and max number of headers in a normal request
            normal_query_param_count_range 0 10    # Min and max number of query parameters in a normal request
            normal_path_segment_count_range 1 5    # Min and max number of path segments in a normal request

            # Additional attributes
            normal_http_methods GET POST           # Allowed HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST)
            normal_user_agents Chrome Firefox      # Allowed User-Agent strings (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
            normal_referrers https://example.com   # Allowed Referrer headers (e.g., trusted domains)

            # Weights (sum = 1)
            request_size_weight 0.3          # Most critical - large or tiny requests often indicate anomalies
            header_count_weight 0.25         # Highly significant - unusual header counts are suspicious
            query_param_count_weight 0.15    # Moderate - unusual query parameters can be indicative
            http_method_weight 0.1           # Important - unusual HTTP methods could be malicious
            user_agent_weight 0.1            # Important - bots or malicious actors often have abnormal User-Agents
            referrer_weight 0.05             # Less significant - deviations may be less impactful
            path_segment_count_weight 0.05   # Less significant - anomalies here are rarer

            # Request history settings
            history_window 10m                     # Time window for considering past requests (e.g., 5m, 1h)
            max_history_entries 100                # Maximum number of past requests to keep in history

            # Per-path configuration for /api
            per_path_config /api {
                anomaly_threshold 0.1
                blocking_threshold 0.2
            }
        }
        respond "Hello, world!"
    }
}
```

This configuration defines thresholds for marking and blocking requests, sets normal ranges for various attributes, and specifies weights for calculating anomaly scores. It also includes settings for request history, which are essential for correlating and analyzing patterns in client behavior. The flexibility of these parameters allows users to simulate various attack scenarios and response strategies.

        }
    }
    ```

## How It Works

The `caddy-mlf` module operates as follows:

1. Extracts attributes from each incoming request, such as request size, header count, and more.
2. Compares these attributes to configured normal ranges and calculates an anomaly score using the specified weights.
3. Retrieves recent request history for the client IP, leveraging historical data to adjust the anomaly score based on past behavior.
4. Takes action based on the final score:
   * If the score meets or exceeds the `blocking_threshold`, the request is blocked.
   * If the score is above the `anomaly_threshold` but below the `blocking_threshold`, the request is marked as suspicious by adding a `X-Suspicious-Traffic` header.
5. Allows non-suspicious requests to proceed to the next middleware or handler in the chain.

This flow ensures that requests are evaluated in real-time, with decisions based on both individual attributes and contextual patterns from recent activity. By maintaining a history of request patterns, the module is able to detect evolving threats and react dynamically to anomalous behavior.

## Use cases

The `caddy-mlf` module can be configured to detect and respond to a variety of web-based attacks. Below are some common attack scenarios and example configurations to help you tailor the module to your specific security needs.

### 1. **Detecting and Blocking SQL Injection Attacks**
SQL injection attacks often involve unusual query parameters or payloads in the request. You can configure `caddy-mlf` to detect such anomalies by setting strict limits on query parameters and request sizes.

```caddy
ml_waf {
    anomaly_threshold 0.7
    blocking_threshold 0.9

    normal_request_size_range 100 2000
    normal_query_param_count_range 0 5

    query_param_count_weight 0.4
    request_size_weight 0.3

    history_window 5m
    max_history_entries 50
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`normal_query_param_count_range 0 5`**: Limits the number of query parameters to a maximum of 5, which is typical for most legitimate requests.
- **`query_param_count_weight 0.4`**: Assigns a high weight to query parameter count deviations, making it a significant factor in anomaly detection.
- **`request_size_weight 0.3`**: Ensures that unusually large requests (which may contain SQL injection payloads) are flagged.

### 2. **Mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks**
XSS attacks often involve malicious scripts embedded in request headers or parameters. You can configure `caddy-mlf` to detect anomalies in header counts and user agents.

```caddy
ml_waf {
    anomaly_threshold 0.6
    blocking_threshold 0.85

    normal_header_count_range 5 20
    normal_user_agents Chrome Firefox Safari

    header_count_weight 0.35
    user_agent_weight 0.3

    history_window 10m
    max_history_entries 100
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`normal_header_count_range 5 20`**: Sets a reasonable range for the number of headers in a request.
- **`normal_user_agents Chrome Firefox Safari`**: Only allows requests from common browsers, blocking requests with unusual or malicious User-Agent strings.
- **`header_count_weight 0.35`**: Assigns a high weight to header count deviations, which can indicate XSS payloads in headers.
- **`user_agent_weight 0.3`**: Ensures that requests with suspicious User-Agent strings are flagged.

### 3. **Preventing Brute Force Attacks**
Brute force attacks involve a high volume of requests from the same IP address in a short period. You can configure `caddy-mlf` to detect and block such behavior by leveraging the request history feature.

```caddy
ml_waf {
    anomaly_threshold 0.8
    blocking_threshold 0.95

    history_window 1m
    max_history_entries 20

    request_size_weight 0.2
    header_count_weight 0.2
    query_param_count_weight 0.2
    path_segment_count_weight 0.2
    http_method_weight 0.1
    user_agent_weight 0.1
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`history_window 1m`**: Analyzes requests from the last minute to detect high-frequency patterns.
- **`max_history_entries 20`**: Limits the number of requests from a single IP address within the history window.
- **Low weights for individual attributes**: Focuses more on the frequency of requests rather than their content, which is typical for brute force attacks.

### 4. **Detecting Path Traversal Attacks**
Path traversal attacks involve unusual path segments in the URL. You can configure `caddy-mlf` to detect such anomalies by setting strict limits on the number of path segments.

```caddy
ml_waf {
    anomaly_threshold 0.75
    blocking_threshold 0.9

    normal_path_segment_count_range 1 4

    path_segment_count_weight 0.5
    request_size_weight 0.2
    header_count_weight 0.2
    query_param_count_weight 0.1
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`normal_path_segment_count_range 1 4`**: Limits the number of path segments to a maximum of 4, which is typical for most legitimate requests.
- **`path_segment_count_weight 0.5`**: Assigns a high weight to path segment count deviations, making it a significant factor in anomaly detection.
- **`request_size_weight 0.2` and `header_count_weight 0.2`**: Ensures that other attributes are also considered, but with less emphasis.

### 5. **Blocking Unusual HTTP Methods**
Some attacks involve the use of uncommon HTTP methods (e.g., `PUT`, `DELETE`, `TRACE`). You can configure `caddy-mlf` to allow only specific HTTP methods and block the rest.

```caddy
ml_waf {
    anomaly_threshold 0.7
    blocking_threshold 0.9

    normal_http_methods GET POST

    http_method_weight 0.4
    request_size_weight 0.2
    header_count_weight 0.2
    query_param_count_weight 0.1
    path_segment_count_weight 0.1
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`normal_http_methods GET POST`**: Only allows `GET` and `POST` requests, blocking other methods that are often used in attacks.
- **`http_method_weight 0.4`**: Assigns a high weight to HTTP method deviations, making it a significant factor in anomaly detection.
- **Lower weights for other attributes**: Ensures that the focus is primarily on the HTTP method.

### 6. **Detecting Malicious Referrers**
Some attacks involve requests with suspicious or spoofed Referrer headers. You can configure `caddy-mlf` to allow only specific referrers and block the rest.

```caddy
ml_waf {
    anomaly_threshold 0.7
    blocking_threshold 0.9

    normal_referrers https://trustedsite.com https://anothertrustedsite.com

    referrer_weight 0.5
    request_size_weight 0.2
    header_count_weight 0.2
    query_param_count_weight 0.1
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **`normal_referrers https://trustedsite.com https://anothertrustedsite.com`**: Only allows requests from trusted referrers.
- **`referrer_weight 0.5`**: Assigns a high weight to Referrer header deviations, making it a significant factor in anomaly detection.
- **Lower weights for other attributes**: Ensures that the focus is primarily on the Referrer header.
