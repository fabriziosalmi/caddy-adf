## 3. How it Works

`caddy-mlf` operates by:

1.  **Attribute Extraction:** Extracting attributes from each incoming HTTP request, such as the request size, header count, query parameters, path segments, HTTP method, User-Agent, Referrer, and request frequency.
2.  **Anomaly Score Calculation:** Calculating an anomaly score based on configured weights, comparing request attributes to the defined "normal" ranges and behaviors. The score considers factors like request size, header and parameter counts, path segments, method, agent, referrer and request frequency, using configurable weights.
3.  **Request History Tracking:** Maintains a history of requests for each client IP within a configurable time window, enabling detection of suspicious patterns over time and request correlation. This history is sharded to optimize performance.
4.  **Threshold-Based Action:** Taking action based on the calculated anomaly score:
    *   **Blocking:** If the anomaly score meets or exceeds the `blocking_threshold`, the request is blocked with a 403 Forbidden response.
    *   **Marking as Suspicious:** If the anomaly score is above the `anomaly_threshold` but below the `blocking_threshold`, the request is marked as suspicious by adding an `X-Suspicious-Traffic: true` header to the response.
5.  **Normal Request Processing:** Allowing normal requests to proceed to the next middleware or handler in the chain.

### Scoring Mechanism

The anomaly score is calculated by combining normalized attribute scores with their corresponding weights:

1.  **Normalization:** Each attribute (request size, header count, query parameter count, path segment count) is normalized based on its configured `min` and `max` range.
    - If the value is within the normal range, the normalized value is `0.0`.
    - If the value is less than the minimum, the value is the positive ratio of the difference from the minimum, divided by `(min + 1)`.
    - If the value is greater than the maximum, the value is the natural logarithm of the difference from the maximum, divided by `(max + 1) + 1`.
2.  **Weighting:** Each normalized attribute is multiplied by its respective weight (`request_size_weight`, `header_count_weight`, etc.).
3.  **Frequency Score:** If `request_frequency_weight` is set, the request frequency over the `history_window` is calculated and multiplied by the frequency weight.
4.  **Method, User-Agent, Referrer Scores:** Requests that do not match the defined `normal_http_methods`, `normal_user_agents`, and `normal_referrers` will be penalized by the weights: `http_method_weight`, `user_agent_weight`, and `referrer_weight`.
5.  **Correlation Score:** The history is checked for previous suspicious requests (above `anomaly_threshold`). A correlation score is added, giving more weight to suspicious traffic that is part of a correlated pattern over time.
6.  **Total Score:** The weighted, normalized values are summed up to create the final anomaly score.

## 6. Use Cases and Examples

Here are some practical use cases with example configurations:

### 1. Detecting and Blocking Brute Force Attacks

```caddyfile
ml_waf {
    anomaly_threshold 0.6
    blocking_threshold 0.8

    request_frequency_weight 0.3 # increased weight for request frequency
    history_window 1m
    max_history_entries 50

    request_size_weight 0.2
    header_count_weight 0.2
    query_param_count_weight 0.2
    path_segment_count_weight 0.1
    http_method_weight 0.1
    user_agent_weight 0.1
}
```

**Explanation:**

-   `request_frequency_weight 0.3`: Emphasizes request frequency to detect rapid login attempts.
-   `history_window 1m`: Tracks recent requests for quick detection.
-   `max_history_entries 50`: Limits the history to a reasonable amount.

### 2. Mitigating DDoS Attacks

```caddyfile
ml_waf {
    anomaly_threshold 0.7
    blocking_threshold 0.9

    request_frequency_weight 0.15  # Moderate weight for request frequency
    history_window 10m
    max_history_entries 100

    request_size_weight 0.25
    header_count_weight 0.2
    query_param_count_weight 0.15
    path_segment_count_weight 0.1
    http_method_weight 0.1
    user_agent_weight 0.1
    referrer_weight 0.05
}
```

**Explanation:**

-   `request_frequency_weight 0.15`: A moderate weight is assigned for request frequency.
-   `history_window 10m`: Examines traffic over a longer period for distributed attacks.
-   `max_history_entries 100`: A larger history is kept for identifying larger attacks.

### 3. Preventing Scanning Activities

```caddyfile
ml_waf {
    anomaly_threshold 0.5
    blocking_threshold 0.8

    request_frequency_weight 0.1  # Lower weight for request frequency
    history_window 5m
    max_history_entries 50

    request_size_weight 0.3
    header_count_weight 0.25
    query_param_count_weight 0.2
    path_segment_count_weight 0.15
    http_method_weight 0.1
}
```

**Explanation:**

-   `request_frequency_weight 0.1`: Reduces the focus on frequency, emphasizing other request features.
-   `history_window 5m`: Tracks requests over a moderate window for scanning activity.
-   `max_history_entries 50`: Keeps a reasonable history size.

### 4. Protecting Specific Endpoints

```caddyfile
ml_waf {
    anomaly_threshold 0.4
    blocking_threshold 0.7

    request_frequency_weight 0.2
    history_window 5m
    max_history_entries 100

    request_size_weight 0.2
    header_count_weight 0.2
    query_param_count_weight 0.2
    path_segment_count_weight 0.2
    http_method_weight 0.1
    user_agent_weight 0.1

    per_path_config /admin {
        anomaly_threshold 0.1
        blocking_threshold 0.3
    }

    per_path_config /sensitive-api {
        anomaly_threshold 0.2
        blocking_threshold 0.4
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

-   Global thresholds are set for general protection.
-   `per_path_config` is used to apply stricter thresholds for sensitive paths like `/admin` and `/sensitive-api`.

## 7. Advanced Configuration

### Tuning Weights

The `caddy-mlf` module uses weights to determine the contribution of different request attributes to the anomaly score. These weights allow you to customize the module's sensitivity to various aspects of incoming requests. Effective weight tuning is crucial for achieving a balance between security and usability.

-   **Increase weights** for attributes that are more indicative of malicious activity for your application. For example:
    *   If your application is often targeted by brute-force attacks with large request sizes, increase `request_size_weight`.
    *   If you see attacks using unusual headers, increase `header_count_weight`.
    *    If you have an API with a well-defined set of methods, increase `http_method_weight`.
    *    If your legitimate users use well-known user-agents, increase `user_agent_weight`.
-   **Decrease weights** for attributes that are less relevant to security in your specific scenario. For example:
    *   If your application handles a lot of large data uploads that are not typically malicious, decrease `request_size_weight`.
    *   If you have a lot of legitimate requests with varying numbers of query parameters, decrease `query_param_count_weight`.
-   **Start with small values:** When tuning weights, start with small adjustments and monitor how these changes affect your anomaly scores. Don't make drastic changes immediately.
-   **Normalize your weights:** While not strictly required, consider normalizing your weights so that their total is a manageable number (e.g., summing up to 1.0 or 100). This can make it easier to reason about how much influence each attribute has on the total score. For example, if you want request size to be half of the score and header count the other half, you can set both to `0.5` (assuming other weights are zeroed or are less important).

    ```caddyfile
    ml_waf {
        request_size_weight  0.5  # Emphasize request size
        header_count_weight  0.3  # Emphasize header count
        query_param_count_weight 0.1
        path_segment_count_weight 0.1
        # ... other weights
    }
    ```

### Fine-Tuning Thresholds

Thresholds determine when a request is considered suspicious or is blocked. Setting these values correctly is vital for minimizing false positives and false negatives.

-   **Start with conservative thresholds:** Begin with higher `anomaly_threshold` and `blocking_threshold` values to minimize false positives. This means that initially, the module will only flag or block highly unusual requests. For example, you might set an `anomaly_threshold` of `0.6` and `blocking_threshold` of `0.8` initially, and gradually reduce these as needed.

    ```caddyfile
     ml_waf {
       anomaly_threshold 0.6
       blocking_threshold 0.8
       # ... other options
     }
     ```

-   **Monitor logs:** Regularly check your Caddy logs (especially in `debug` mode) for suspicious requests or blocked requests. This will give you data to understand if you need to adjust your thresholds. Pay particular attention to the anomaly score and the context of each request.
-   **Adjust incrementally:** Fine-tune the thresholds gradually based on the observed behavior. For example:
    *   If you see too many legitimate requests marked as suspicious, lower your `anomaly_threshold`.
    *   If you see malicious requests getting through, lower your `blocking_threshold`.
-   **Use per-path configurations** to apply tighter rules to more sensitive parts of your application. For instance:

    ```caddyfile
        ml_waf {
            anomaly_threshold 0.4      # Global settings
            blocking_threshold 0.7

            per_path_config /admin {
                anomaly_threshold 0.1   # Stricter settings for /admin path
                blocking_threshold 0.2
            }
        }
    ```

-   **Consider environment:** The right thresholds might depend on your environment and application. A more security-critical application might require lower thresholds and more aggressive rules compared to a low-impact application.

### Understanding Request History

The request history mechanism helps to identify patterns of attack and correlate suspicious behavior over time. It allows the module to adapt and flag continuous patterns of malicious traffic coming from the same IPs. Here's how to best utilize it:

-   **`history_window`:** Set this value based on your observation window. If your application needs quick reaction times to attacks that occur in short bursts, shorten the window. For slower attacks (like scanning activities or low-frequency brute-force attempts), keep a longer window.
    *   **Short Window (e.g., 1-5 minutes):** Suitable for quickly detecting and reacting to sudden spikes in activity, such as brute-force login attempts.

        ```caddyfile
        ml_waf {
            history_window 2m
            # ... other options
        }
        ```
    *   **Longer Window (e.g., 10+ minutes):** Better for detecting distributed attacks or slow scanning behavior that might not be obvious over a short time.

        ```caddyfile
         ml_waf {
             history_window 20m
             # ... other options
         }
        ```
-   **`max_history_entries`:** Adjust the number of entries based on traffic volume and your system's memory capabilities.
    *   **Lower values:** Use lower values when dealing with high traffic to avoid high memory usage. This will keep the memory footprint small.
    *   **Higher values:** Use higher values if you have low traffic and want to be able to track more requests. This is useful when looking for very specific attack patterns. Be aware that this can consume more memory.

        ```caddyfile
            ml_waf {
                max_history_entries 500
                # ... other options
            }
        ```
-   **Monitor:** Keep an eye on your logs, where information about the history and anomaly score of every request is logged using the `debug` level. Look for patterns in anomaly scores over time for specific IPs to get insights into the behavior of potential attackers.
-   **Adjust history along with request frequency:** When you tune `request_frequency_weight`, you should adjust `history_window` and `max_history_entries` to match your expected traffic and attack patterns. A very high `request_frequency_weight` will probably need a lower history window and fewer entries.

## 8. Troubleshooting

### Detailed Debugging

To get the most out of troubleshooting, use the `debug` log level in your Caddyfile:

```caddyfile
{
    log {
        level debug
    }
    # ... other global options
}
```

This provides detailed information about each request, the calculated anomaly scores, and any decisions made by `caddy-mlf`.

### Common Issues

1.  **False Positives:** If legitimate requests are being flagged as suspicious, try:
    *   Increasing the `anomaly_threshold` and/or `blocking_threshold`.
    *   Adjusting `normal_*_range` values to match normal traffic patterns.
    *   Reviewing the weights to ensure they accurately reflect the importance of different parameters.

2.  **Requests Not Being Blocked:** If malicious requests are not being blocked, try:
    *   Decreasing the `anomaly_threshold` and/or `blocking_threshold`.
    *   Increasing the weights to emphasize attack indicators.
    *   Verifying that the configuration is loaded and that the module is correctly placed in the Caddy middleware chain.

3.  **Performance Issues:** If you notice performance degradation, try:
    *   Reducing the `history_window`.
    *   Lowering the `max_history_entries`.
    *   Optimizing your Caddy configuration.
    *   Ensuring that your system has adequate resources.

4.  **Module Not Loaded:** If the module doesn't work, ensure the module binary is placed correctly and that Caddy is restarted correctly.
